Dear Nubank recruitment team,
Nubank
Bogot√° D.C.,

Lover of technology, art and innovation; I am sebastian oviedo, a Multimedia Engineering professional who started a couple of years ago in this technological world and who today does not stop dreaming. I turned my profession into a passion and although I am very young I have also seen companies grow very fast.

During these two years of professional life I have worked in small SCRUM teams as a full stack developer in process automation, back and front integrations, service development and improvement, and CI / CD. I have discarded myself for my commitment and curiosity, which has allowed me to easily adapt to the projects in which I have been part.

I like stories, therefore I am a fan of unicorns and to see how this type of companies materialize an idea and revolutionize the way of doing things. That's why I want to be part of the Nu! Team.

Best Regards,

Juan Sebastian Oviedo Vega
